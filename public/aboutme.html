        Ever since I was little, I've always loved sciences â€” especially biology and chemistry.
        At first, I thought I would study veterinary medicine because Iâ€™ve always had a strong connection to animals.
        But when I started the International Baccalaureate in high school and we went deeper into human biology, something just clicked for me.
        Learning about the human body, how complex and fascinating it is, made me realize that my real passion was in medicine, biomedical science, and biochemistry.
        At the same time, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to computer science.
        My teachers made sure we understood how important it was for the future, and Iâ€™m grateful they did.
        Problem-solving has always been something I genuinely enjoy â€” whether itâ€™s finishing a Sudoku puzzle, working through a tricky math problem, or figuring out strategies in chess.
        For me, finding solutions isn't just a task â€” itâ€™s something that I find exciting.
        I believe the future will be shaped by the connection between science and technology, and I want to be part of that.

        Swimming has been a huge part of my life.
        I started swimming when I was six years old, and by eight, I was competing professionally.
        Sports have always been important in my family â€” both my parents are athletes â€” and they passed that love of competition, discipline, and teamwork onto me and my siblings.
        Swimming taught me a lot more than just how to race â€” it taught me about commitment, focus, and how to stay strong even when things get tough.
        Those lessons have stayed with me, not just in sports but in everything I do, from my studies to my personal life.
        When I'm not swimming or studying, I love exploring new cities, listening to music, and spending time with my friends and family.
        Iâ€™m always looking for new things to learn and new ways to challenge myself.

        This past semester, I took a course called BioBusiness and BioEntrepreneurship, and it completely changed the way I see my future career.
        I originally planned to go straight into medicine after finishing my bachelorâ€™s degree, but through this course, I realized how many incredible opportunities exist within big pharma and the biotech industry.
        My dad has been a huge inspiration to me â€” starting his own business and immigrating to another country to build a better future for our family.
        His passion for his work has always motivated me to chase success in a field I truly love.
        I want to find a career path that excites me every day, something that feels fulfilling â€” not like a chore â€” and now, I can really see myself thriving in the world of biotechnology and business.

        One of my main goals over the next couple of years is to secure internships â€” both in my second and third year â€” to gain hands-on experience and explore different areas within biomedical sciences. I want to immerse myself in real-world environments where I can apply what Iâ€™m learning, ask questions, and continue growing both professionally and personally.
        After completing my undergraduate degree, I hope to either apply to medical school or pursue a masterâ€™s degree, specializing in a field that truly inspires me, whether thatâ€™s biochemistry, clinical research, or biotechnology.
        Traveling has always been a passion of mine, and I would love to intertwine it with my career.
        One of my dreams is to work with organizations like Doctors Without Borders, providing medical assistance in communities around the world where healthcare access is limited.
        Beyond that, Iâ€™m interested in collaborating with global health initiatives and research projects that focus on infectious diseases, maternal health, and developing innovative, affordable medical technologies for underserved populations.
        I want my work to have real impact â€” not just in labs or hospitals, but also across borders, reaching people who need it the most. My goal is to build a career that combines science, compassion, and a true global perspective.
